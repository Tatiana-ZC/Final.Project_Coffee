## Introduction
Hi visitor! and welcome to my Ironhack Data Analytics capstone project! 

This end-to-end data analytics project is the showcase of the skills and knowledge I've acquired during the Ironhack Bootcamp 2024. Through this work, I aim to demonstrate my expertise as a market researcher and my ability to tackle real-world problems using data analysis resources. This project not only highlights my proficiency in business acumen and as a market researcher; but it also expose my skills in data gathering, manipulation, analytics and visualisations. This project also serves as a tool to learn about the heart-warming Coffee Industry and its impact in our society.

## Business Understanding
Coffee is not just a popular beverage; it’s a crucial global commodity that supports the livelihoods of millions of small producers in developing countries. Every day, over 2.25 billion cups of coffee are consumed worldwide—enough to circle the globe 12 times if lined up in cups. Over 90% of coffee production occurs in developing nations, particularly in South America, yet most consumption happens in industrialized economies.

With 25 million small producers depending on coffee cultivation for their income, this industry involves more people than the entire population of Australia. In Brazil, which produces almost a third of the world’s coffee, over five million people are employed in the coffee sector—a number nearly equivalent to the entire population of Norway. Unlike sugar cane or cattle farming, coffee cultivation is labor-intensive and cannot be fully automated, requiring frequent human attention.

Unroasted, or green, coffee beans are one of the most traded agricultural commodities globally, with a market size comparable to the global steel or oil industries. Coffee trading, particularly in commodity exchanges such as those in New York, underscores coffee's significance in international trade. Major European trading and processing hubs, such as Hamburg and Trieste, further highlight its global importance, much like the financial markets in London or the shipping ports of Rotterdam.
